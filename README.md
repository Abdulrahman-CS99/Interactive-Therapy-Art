# Interactive-Therapy-Art

## Sumarry:
The idea of this project is to create an interactive board that acts like a therapist by drawing a paint that improves the user's current emotion. We took a pre-trained model from this model[Speech-Emotion-Analyzer](https://github.com/MITESHPUTHRANNEU/Speech-Emotion-Analyzer) to help us detecting user's emotion from the tone of the speaker.
