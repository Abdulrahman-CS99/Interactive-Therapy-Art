# Interactive-Therapy-Art

## Sumarry:
The idea of this project is to creare an interactive board that acts like a therapy by drawing a paint that improves user's current emotion. We took a pre trained model from this model [Speech-Emotion-Analyzer](https://github.com/MITESHPUTHRANNEU/Speech-Emotion-Analyzer) to help us detecting user's emotion from the tone.
